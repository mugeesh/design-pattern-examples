* The Command pattern is a behaviour design pattern in 
* which an object is used to represent
and encapsulate all the information needed to call a method at later time.
* This information includes the method name, the object that owns the method and values for method parameter.

 1. Allows you to store list of code that is executed at a later time or many times.
 2. Client says I want a specific command to run when executes() is called on 1 of these encapsulated (hidden) Objects.
 3. An object called the Invoker transfer this command to another object called a reciever to execute thie right code.
 4. example : TurnTVOn -DeviceButton-TurnTVOn-Television.TurnTVOn()
