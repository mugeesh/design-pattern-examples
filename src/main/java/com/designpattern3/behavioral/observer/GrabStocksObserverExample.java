/*
Observer is a behaviour design pattern that lets you define a subscription mechanism to notify multiple objects 
about any events that happen to the object theyâ€™re observing. ::refactoring.guru
 */
/*
 * When we need many objects to receive an update when another object changes.
 * Stock market: with thousands of stocks need to send to update to objects representing individual socks.
 * The Subject (Publisher) sends many stocks to the Observers
 * The Observers(subscribers) takes the one they want and use them. 
 */

/*
 * Benifit :
 * *Loose coupling (subject/publisher doen't need to know  anything about the observers(subscribers)
 * Negatives: The SUbject(Publisher) may send updates that don't matter to the observer(subscriber)
